This image is a floor plan. Detect the shapes (outline lines) of the labeled furniture/equipment and return tight bounding boxes around the outer contour of each item.

Important:
Do NOT draw bounding boxes around printed text in the image (e.g., the words "Sink", "Storage" themselves).
Use the text only to identify which furniture/equipment item it refers to, but the bounding box must enclose the drawn shape (the actual outline) of the item.
Even if the label text overlaps the furniture, ignore the text and box only the outer contour of the shape.
Do NOT include walls, windows, doors, or other architectural lines.

This image is a floor plan. Detect only room inner boundary frames (inside face of walls).
Return a JSON list where each entry has keys "label", "box_2d", and "mask".
Use label "room_inner_frame" for exactly one global main interior envelope and "subroom_inner_frame" for each enclosed sub-room.
The main room_inner_frame must be the largest axis-aligned rectangle that stays inside inner wall lines of the whole unit.
Do NOT shrink the main room to avoid subrooms; subroom_inner_frame may be inside/overlap the main room rectangle.
Each subroom_inner_frame must also be the largest axis-aligned rectangle inside that enclosed subroom, touching enclosing inner walls whenever possible.
Each frame must be tight to inside wall lines with zero intentional padding (no inset and no expansion), and expanded maximally until any side would cross outside inner walls.
Do not shrink any frame to avoid text labels; prioritize wall lines over text glyphs.
The mask must represent interior floor area for that same rectangle.
Do not include wall thickness, exterior space, furniture, text labels, doors, or windows.
box_2d must be the tight rectangle of the returned mask.

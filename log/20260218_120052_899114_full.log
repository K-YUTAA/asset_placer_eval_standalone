- Total size: **4.63m (X width) x 5.19m (Y depth)**
- Scale reference: **SCALE_WIDTH_M=4.63, SCALE_HEIGHT_M=5.19** (treated as exact). A dotted grid is visible in the plan image and was used only as a proportional aid.

## Rooms
- **room_1 / Bedroom (main space)**: polygon vertices *(clockwise)*  
  - (0.00, 0.00)  
  - (4.63, 0.00)  
  - (4.63, 5.19)  
  - (1.55, 5.19)  
  - (1.55, 3.64)  
  - (0.00, 3.64)

- **room_2 / Toilet**: polygon vertices *(clockwise)*

  - (0.00, 5.19)  
  - (1.55, 5.19)  
  - (1.55, 3.64)

*(Note: Storage areas shown on the plan are treated as built-in cabinetry/fixtures within the bedroom zone rather than separate “rooms”, to remain consistent with the provided ROOMS requirements.)*

## Objects
- **Bed** *(bed)*: center **(1.12, 1.60)**, ΔX_world **1.70**, ΔY_world **2.10**, size **(L x W x H) = 1.70 x 2.10 x 0.55**, rotationZ **180°**  
  - Interpretation: headboard toward +Y, foot toward -Y (bed “front” toward -Y).

- **Chair** *(chair)*: center **(3.10, 2.65)**, ΔX_world **0.75**, ΔY_world **0.75**, size **0.75 x 0.75 x 0.90**, rotationZ **90°**  
  - Faces toward +X (toward the TV cabinet on the right wall).

- **TV Cabinet / Media Console** *(tv_cabinet)*: center **(4.18, 2.65)**, ΔX_world **0.60**, ΔY_world **1.60**, size **1.60 x 0.60 x 0.60**, rotationZ **270°**  
  - Screen/front faces **-X** into the room.

- **Sink / Vanity** *(sink)*: center **(4.18, 4.05)**, ΔX_world **0.60**, ΔY_world **0.55**, size **0.55 x 0.60 x 0.85**, rotationZ **270°**  
  - Front faces **-X** into the bedroom.

  - Oriented so the seated user faces **-Y** (toward the toilet room interior).

- **Built-in Storage (right, upper)** *(storage_cabinet)*: center **(4.18, 4.90)**, ΔX_world **0.90**, ΔY_world **0.58**, size **0.90 x 0.58 x 2.20**, rotationZ **270°**  
  - Treated as a tall cabinet zone along the right side near the top.

## Openings
- **Door (Sliding) — Bedroom ↔ Toilet**  
  - center **(1.55, 4.30)** on the shared wall (x=1.55)  
  - width **0.80m**, height **2.05m**  
  - connects **Bedroom <-> Toilet**  
  - (Sliding door; “opens” conceptually toward the larger space = Bedroom.)

- **Door (Sliding) — Bedroom ↔ Outside**  
  - center **(2.85, 5.19)** on the top wall (y=5.19)  
  - width **2.30m**, height **2.05m**  
  - connects **Bedroom <-> outside**

- **Window (bottom wall)**  
  - center **(3.20, 0.00)** on the bottom wall (y=0.00)  
  - width **2.40m**, height **1.20m** *(from hints)*  
  - sill height **1.00m** *(from hints)*

If you want, I can also provide a “wall list” (each wall segment with start/end coordinates) derived from the room polygons to simplify procedural wall generation.

[prompt1]
You are an interior layout analyst. Generate a detailed layout description for 3D scene generation.

Coordinate system (Z-Up, Isaac Sim):
- X: right (+X), left (-X)
- Y: forward/depth in the image (+Y toward top), backward (-Y toward bottom)
- Z: height (up)
- Origin (0, 0): bottom-left INNER corner of the WALKABLE FLOOR AREA (inside the walls)
- Units: meters
- Coordinates must be NON-NEGATIVE (X>=0, Y>=0)

### LAYOUT_HINTS (AUTHORITATIVE)
You will also receive a key-value text block like:
OUTLINE=RECT
SCALE_WIDTH_M=...
SCALE_HEIGHT_M=...
ROOMS=...bedroom:1,...toilet:1,...
DOOR_COUNT=...
WINDOW_COUNT=...
WINDOW_HEIGHT_M=...
WINDOW_SILL_M=...

Hard rules:
- If SCALE_WIDTH_M / SCALE_HEIGHT_M are given, treat them as the EXACT plan size. Do NOT re-estimate.
- If OUTLINE=RECT, the outer boundary is exactly a rectangle [0..SCALE_WIDTH_M] x [0..SCALE_HEIGHT_M].
- Use ROOMS counts as required rooms. If a room type count is 1, you MUST output that room.
- Room polygons must NOT overlap. Adjacent rooms must share EXACT boundary coordinates.
  If a small room (e.g., toilet) occupies a corner, the main room polygon should become CONCAVE to exclude it.

### How to measure (grid is optional)
- If the plan contains a 1m dotted grid: use grid counting as the PRIMARY measurement tool.
- If no grid is visible: use SCALE_* as the absolute size and estimate positions by proportional distances.

### Object coordinate convention (CRITICAL)
- ALL object positions are CENTER coordinates of the object footprint (top-down).
- Do NOT use corners (top-left/bottom-left) for X,Y.
- Do NOT use the text label position as the object center; use the drawn geometry.

### Output precision (IMPORTANT)
- Use 0.01m precision (two decimals) for ALL coordinates and sizes.
- Doors/windows positions must be the CENTER point of the opening on the wall edge.

### RotationZ (functional front)
- 0°: faces +Y
- 90°: faces +X
- 180°: faces -Y
- 270°: faces -X

Functional front per category:
- Chair/Sofa: direction a seated person would face.
- Bed: headboard -> foot direction.
- TV/Monitor: screen facing direction.
- Cabinet/Drawer/Refrigerator: opening/front direction.
- Door: direction the door opens into the room interior. (If unclear, face the larger adjacent space.)

### Length/Width assignment rule (prevents size/rotation bugs)
For each object:
1) First decide rotationZ (functional front).
2) Measure the object's WORLD footprint extents from the plan:
   - ΔX_world = size along X axis
   - ΔY_world = size along Y axis
3) Assign (Length, Width) CONSISTENTLY with rotationZ:
   - If rotationZ is 0 or 180:
       Length ≈ ΔX_world, Width ≈ ΔY_world
   - If rotationZ is 90 or 270:
       Length ≈ ΔY_world, Width ≈ ΔX_world

### Sanity checks (must do before finalizing)
- Every object center must lie inside the outer boundary.
- Objects must not overlap walls (keep a small margin from room boundaries).
- Relative ordering must match the image:
  If object A is clearly left of object B in the plan, then A_X < B_X (same for above/below).
- If any check fails, your origin or center-coordinate convention is wrong: redo measurement.

Your task (Step1):
1) Report overall floor plan size (use SCALE_* as exact if provided).
2) Identify all rooms. For each room, output a room polygon (vertices in CLOCKWISE order).
3) List ALL visible objects with:
   - center (X,Y), WORLD extents (ΔX_world, ΔY_world), size (Length x Width x Height), rotationZ.
4) Identify doors and windows with their wall-edge center coordinates.

Output format (structured bullet points):

## Overall
- Total size: [X]m x [Y]m
- Scale reference: (SCALE_* and grid if present)

## Rooms
- [room_id / name]: polygon vertices (clockwise)

## Objects
- [object_name] ([category]): center (X,Y), ΔX_world, ΔY_world, size (L x W x H), rotationZ

## Openings
- Door: center (X,Y), width, height, connects [Room A] <-> [Room B or outside]
- Window: center (X,Y), width, height, sill height

system_input='''You are a 2D layout-to-3D scene expert. Interpret a top-down 2D floor plan and output a JSON scene description.
The top-down view of the resulting 3D scene must match the plan.

Coordinate system (Z-Up, Isaac Sim):
- X: right (+X)
- Y: forward (+Y toward top of image)
- Z: up
- Origin (0,0): lower-left INNER corner of the walkable floor area (inside the walls)

COORDINATE NORMALIZATION (CRITICAL):
- Output coordinates must be NON-NEGATIVE (X>=0, Y>=0).
- area_size_X must equal max X of outer_polygon. area_size_Y must equal max Y of outer_polygon.

CRITICAL UNIT RULE:
- All coordinates and dimensions must be in METERS.

Do NOT output any prose. Output MUST be valid JSON only.

### LAYOUT_HINTS (AUTHORITATIVE)
You will receive a key-value text block like:
OUTLINE=RECT
SCALE_WIDTH_M=...
SCALE_HEIGHT_M=...
ROOMS=...bedroom:1,...toilet:1,...
WINDOW_HEIGHT_M=...
WINDOW_SILL_M=...

Hard rules:
- area_size_X = SCALE_WIDTH_M and area_size_Y = SCALE_HEIGHT_M (exact).
- If OUTLINE=RECT, outer_polygon MUST be:
  (0,0) -> (area_size_X,0) -> (area_size_X,area_size_Y) -> (0,area_size_Y)
- If ROOMS indicates 2+ rooms with count 1, you MUST use the "rooms" array.
  You MUST NOT use the single-room fallback "room_polygon".
- Room polygons must NOT overlap. Adjacent rooms must share EXACT boundary coordinates.
  If needed, make the main room polygon CONCAVE to exclude small rooms (toilet, closet, etc).

### OBJECT COORDINATE CONVENTION (CRITICAL)
For every entry in area_objects_list:
- X,Y are the CENTER of the object footprint rectangle.
- NEVER use corner coordinates for X,Y.
- Length = local +X, Width = local +Y (functional front). Do NOT swap Length/Width after choosing rotationZ.

### Length/Width assignment rule (prevents size/rotation bugs)
If Step1 provides WORLD extents (ΔX_world, ΔY_world), use them:
- If rotationZ is 0 or 180:
    Length ≈ ΔX_world, Width ≈ ΔY_world
- If rotationZ is 90 or 270:
    Length ≈ ΔY_world, Width ≈ ΔX_world

### Coordinate fidelity (prevents drift)
- If Step1 numeric coordinates/sizes are provided, COPY them exactly into JSON.
  Do NOT re-estimate or re-scale from the image unless Step1 is missing.
- Use 0.01m precision.

### Opening coordinates convention
- For doors/windows in "openings": X,Y denote the CENTER point of the opening on the wall edge.
- Openings must lie exactly on a room boundary edge.

Placement rules:
1) Preserve the layout as drawn.
2) Always include a FLOOR object.
3) Do NOT output wall objects (walls come from room polygons).
4) For every door opening, also add a matching door object to area_objects_list.

RotationZ:
- 0: faces +Y, 90: faces +X, 180: faces -Y, 270: faces -X

Categories:
bed, table, desk, chair, sofa, wardrobe, drawer, shelf, cabinet,
toilet, sink, bathtub, shower, door, window, floor, appliance, equipment, other_furniture

search_prompt:
- Mostly English, generic description, no relative placement.

Remember: Output a single JSON object ONLY.
'''

user_input='''You have been provided a floor plan image, LAYOUT_HINTS, and (optionally) Step1 numeric layout.

[SIZE_MODE OVERRIDE]
This override has highest priority over any previous size definition.
Use top-level `size_mode` = "local".
Length = object local +X (right), Width = object local +Y (forward / functional front), Height = local +Z.
rotationZ defines where object local +Y points in world (0:+Y, 90:+X, 180:-Y, 270:-X).
Do NOT swap Length/Width based on rotationZ.

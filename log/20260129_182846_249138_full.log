## Overall
- Total size: **~19.0m (X width) x ~9.0m (Y depth)**
- Scale reference: **Typical single-car garage + standard furniture sizes** (car ~4.5m long, beds ~2.0m long, dining table ~1.6m). The plan shows a light grid but no explicit scale; dimensions are inferred to keep circulation and furniture clearances realistic.

If you want higher accuracy for the room polygons (because the outer boundary “steps” around the upper rooms), I can also output a **building exterior outline polygon** and then align all room walls to that outline.

[prompt1]
You are an interior layout analyst. Generate a detailed layout description for 3D scene generation.

Coordinate system (Z-Up, Isaac Sim):
- X: right (+X), left (-X)
- Y: forward/depth in the image (+Y toward top), backward (-Y toward bottom)
- Z: height (up)
- Origin (0, 0): bottom-left inner corner of the floor plan
- Units: meters

Your task:
1. Estimate the overall floor plan size (width X, depth Y) in meters.
2. Identify all rooms. For each room, estimate its bounding box and approximate polygon vertices.
3. List ALL visible objects with their estimated center coordinates (X, Y), size (Length x Width x Height), and orientation.
4. Identify doors and windows with their positions on walls.

## Rotation Definitions (CRITICAL)
Use the following rule to determine the rotation angle based on which way the object is "facing" (its functional front):
- 0°: faces +Y (toward top of image)
- 90°: faces +X (toward right of image)
- 180°: faces -Y (toward bottom of image)
- 270°: faces -X (toward left of image)

## Functional Front per Category:
- Chair/Sofa: The direction a seated person would face.
- Bed: From headboard toward the foot of the bed.
- TV/Monitor: The direction the screen is facing.
- Desk/Table: The side where a person would sit (if obvious), otherwise align with room walls.
- Refrigerator/Cabinet/Drawer: The direction it opens.
- Door: The direction the door opens into the room (interior).

## Output format - structured bullet points:

## Overall
- Total size: [X]m x [Y]m
- Scale reference: (describe any visible grid, scale bar, or reference object used)

## Rooms
For each room:
- [Room Name]: center (~X, ~Y), size ~[L]x[W]m, polygon vertices if non-rectangular

## Objects
For each visible object:
- [Object Name] ([category]): center (~X, ~Y), size ~[L]x[W]x[H]m, rotation [0/90/180/270]°, facing [direction/target, e.g., "facing TV" or "facing -Y"]

## Openings
- Door at (~X, ~Y): width ~[W]m, rotation [0/90/180/270]° (opens into room), connects [Room A] to [Room B]
- Window at (~X, ~Y): width ~[W]m, height ~[H]m, on [wall direction]

Be thorough but concise. This output will be used by Step 2 to generate precise JSON.

Coordinate system (Z-Up, Isaac Sim):
- X: right (+X), left (-X)
- Y: forward/depth in the image (+Y toward top of image), backward (-Y toward bottom)
- Z: up (height)
- Origin (0,0): lower-left inner corner of the overall plan

CRITICAL UNIT RULE:
- All coordinates and dimensions must be in METERS.
- If input is in cm, convert to meters (e.g., 250 cm -> 2.5).

Do NOT output any prose. Output MUST be valid JSON only.

MULTI-ROOM JSON SCHEMA (preferred):
{
  "area_name": string,
  "area_size_X": number,  // meters (overall)
  "area_size_Y": number,  // meters (overall)
  "room_polygon": [        // optional single-room fallback
    { "X": number, "Y": number }
  ],
  "outer_polygon": [       // preferred building outline (may be concave)
    { "X": number, "Y": number }
  ],
  "rooms": [               // preferred for multi-room plans
    {
      "room_id": string,

        { "type": "door"|"window", "X": number, "Y": number,
          "Width": number, "Height": number, "SillHeight": number }

Placement rules:
1) The image is an XY top-down plan. Preserve the layout as drawn.
2) Right in the image is +X. Up in the image is +Y.
3) Use Length for the X-axis size, Width for the Y-axis size, Height for Z.
4) Do NOT output any "wall" objects. Walls are procedural from room polygons.
5) Doors/windows: include them in room openings when visible. Do NOT invent openings.
   For every door opening, also add a matching door object to area_objects_list.
   Use rotationZ to indicate the door opens into the room (interior).
6) Keep object placement faithful to the drawing. Do not move objects to fix collisions.
7) Room polygons must not overlap. Adjacent rooms should share the exact same boundary coordinates.
8) Openings must lie exactly on a room boundary edge (same X or same Y for axis-aligned walls).
   If a door is between two rooms, place it on the shared edge (can appear in both rooms or once).
9) If the building outline is not a rectangle, include "outer_polygon" with the true outline (concave allowed).
   Do NOT approximate the outer boundary as a rectangle.

Functional orientation (rotationZ):
- 0 degrees: faces +Y (image up)
- 90 degrees: faces +X (image right)
- 180 degrees: faces -Y (image down)
- 270 degrees: faces -X (image left)

Define functional front per category:
- Bed: direction a person faces from head to foot.
- Chair/Sofa: direction a seated person faces.
- TV/Display: direction the screen faces.
- Door: direction the door opens into the room (interior).
- Refrigerator/Drawer/Cabinet: direction the front opens.

Categories (use one of these unless absolutely necessary):
bed, table, desk, chair, sofa, wardrobe, drawer, shelf, cabinet, wheelchair,
toilet, sink, bathtub, shower, door, window, floor, appliance, equipment, other_furniture

search_prompt guidelines:
- Write mainly in English.
- Describe object type, usage context, and key attributes.
- Do NOT describe relative placement in this specific room.

Remember: Output a single JSON object ONLY.
'''

user_input='''You have been provided a floor plan image and a list of dimensions.
Analyze the image to determine precise placement and orientation of each object.
Then generate the JSON output following the system instructions.'''

[Analysis Text]
## Overall
- Total size: **4.63m (X) x 5.19m (Y)**
- Scale reference: **SCALE_WIDTH_M=4.63, SCALE_HEIGHT_M=5.19** (authoritative). A faint dotted grid is visible in the plan, consistent with ~1m spacing, but all coordinates below are tied to the given SCALE.

---

## Rooms
- **room_1 / Bedroom** (concave to exclude the toilet), polygon vertices (clockwise):
  - (0.00, 0.00)
  - (0.00, 3.35)
  - (1.55, 3.35)
  - (1.55, 4.55)
  - (0.00, 4.55)
  - (0.00, 5.19)
  - (4.63, 5.19)
  - (4.63, 0.00)

- **room_2 / Toilet**, polygon vertices (clockwise):
  - (0.00, 3.35)
  - (0.00, 4.55)
  - (1.55, 4.55)
  - (1.55, 3.35)

Notes:
- The toilet is modeled as a rectangular room inset on the upper-left side.
- All remaining walkable area is assigned to the bedroom (including the open area with bed, chair/TV, and the sink/storage fixtures drawn along the right side).

---

## Objects
(All positions are **center coordinates** of the object footprint. ΔX_world/ΔY_world are the footprint extents along world X/Y.)

- **Bed** (bed):
  - center **(0.95, 1.60)**
  - ΔX_world **1.40**, ΔY_world **2.00**
  - size (L x W x H) **1.40 x 2.00 x 0.55**
  - rotationZ **0°** (headboard assumed at lower-Y side, foot toward +Y)

- **Chair** (chair):
  - center **(3.25, 2.60)**
  - ΔX_world **0.60**, ΔY_world **0.60**
  - size (L x W x H) **0.60 x 0.60 x 0.90**
  - rotationZ **90°** (seated person faces +X toward TV cabinet on right wall)

- **TV Cabinet** (tv_stand / cabinet):
  - center **(4.41, 2.55)**
  - ΔX_world **0.45**, ΔY_world **1.60**
  - size (L x W x H) **1.60 x 0.45 x 0.65**
  - rotationZ **270°** (front/screen faces -X toward the chair)

- **Toilet (WC bowl+tank)** (toilet):
  - center **(0.75, 4.05)**
  - ΔX_world **0.70**, ΔY_world **0.40**
  - size (L x W x H) **0.70 x 0.40 x 0.80**
  - rotationZ **180°** (front faces -Y)

- **Sink Base Cabinet** (sink / vanity):
  - center **(4.36, 4.15)**
  - ΔX_world **0.55**, ΔY_world **0.60**
  - size (L x W x H) **0.60 x 0.55 x 0.90**
  - rotationZ **270°** (front faces -X into the bedroom)

- **Storage Cabinet (top-left, built-in)** (wardrobe / storage):
  - center **(0.78, 4.87)**
  - ΔX_world **1.55**, ΔY_world **0.60**
  - size (L x W x H) **1.55 x 0.60 x 2.20**
  - rotationZ **180°** (front faces -Y toward bedroom interior)

- **Storage Cabinet (top-right, built-in)** (wardrobe / storage):
  - center **(4.33, 4.85)**
  - ΔX_world **0.60**, ΔY_world **0.90**
  - size (L x W x H) **0.90 x 0.60 x 2.20**
  - rotationZ **270°** (front faces -X toward bedroom interior)

Sanity/placement notes:
- Right-wall fixtures (TV cabinet, sink, storage) are placed “flush” to the right boundary by setting centers at **X ≈ 4.63 - depth/2**.
- The bed is offset from the left and bottom walls with a small clearance so it does not intersect boundaries.

## Openings
(Doors/windows listed with the **center point on the wall edge**. Heights use typical defaults where not provided; window height/sill from hints are used.)

### Doors (DOOR_COUNT=2)
- **Door 1 (sliding) — Toilet access**
  - center **(1.55, 4.00)** (on the shared wall between toilet and bedroom at x=1.55)
  - width **0.80m**, height **2.10m**
  - connects **Toilet <-> Bedroom**
  - rotationZ **90°** (opens into/treated as facing the larger space: Bedroom, +X)

- **Door 2 (sliding) — Exterior/top wall**
  - center **(2.70, 5.19)** (on top boundary y=5.19)
  - width **1.80m**, height **2.10m**
  - connects **Bedroom <-> Outside**
  - rotationZ **180°** (opens into Bedroom, toward -Y)

### Windows (WINDOW_COUNT=1)

  - center **(2.85, 0.00)** (on bottom boundary y=0.00)
  - width **2.80m**, height **1.20m**
  - sill height **1.00m** (from hint WINDOW_SILL_M)
  - Notes: The plan also visually suggests another window on the left wall, but per **WINDOW_COUNT=1** only the bottom window is instantiated here.

[prompt1]
You are an interior layout analyst. Generate a detailed layout description for 3D scene generation.

Coordinate system (Z-Up, Isaac Sim):
- X: right (+X), left (-X)
- Y: forward/depth in the image (+Y toward top), backward (-Y toward bottom)
- Z: height (up)
- Origin (0, 0): bottom-left INNER corner of the WALKABLE FLOOR AREA (inside the walls)
- Units: meters
- Coordinates must be NON-NEGATIVE (X>=0, Y>=0)

### LAYOUT_HINTS (AUTHORITATIVE)
You will also receive a key-value text block like:
OUTLINE=RECT
SCALE_WIDTH_M=...
SCALE_HEIGHT_M=...
ROOMS=...bedroom:1,...toilet:1,...
DOOR_COUNT=...
WINDOW_COUNT=...
WINDOW_HEIGHT_M=...
WINDOW_SILL_M=...

Hard rules:
- If SCALE_WIDTH_M / SCALE_HEIGHT_M are given, treat them as the EXACT plan size. Do NOT re-estimate.
- If OUTLINE=RECT, the outer boundary is exactly a rectangle [0..SCALE_WIDTH_M] x [0..SCALE_HEIGHT_M].
- Use ROOMS counts as required rooms. If a room type count is 1, you MUST output that room.
- Room polygons must NOT overlap. Adjacent rooms must share EXACT boundary coordinates.
  If a small room (e.g., toilet) occupies a corner, the main room polygon should become CONCAVE to exclude it.

### How to measure (grid is optional)
- If the plan contains a 1m dotted grid: use grid counting as the PRIMARY measurement tool.
- If no grid is visible: use SCALE_* as the absolute size and estimate positions by proportional distances.

### Object coordinate convention (CRITICAL)
- ALL object positions are CENTER coordinates of the object footprint (top-down).
- Do NOT use corners (top-left/bottom-left) for X,Y.
- Do NOT use the text label position as the object center; use the drawn geometry.

### Output precision (IMPORTANT)
- Use 0.01m precision (two decimals) for ALL coordinates and sizes.
- Doors/windows positions must be the CENTER point of the opening on the wall edge.

### RotationZ (functional front)
- 0°: faces +Y
- 90°: faces +X
- 180°: faces -Y
- 270°: faces -X

Functional front per category:
- Chair/Sofa: direction a seated person would face.
- Bed: headboard -> foot direction.
- TV/Monitor: screen facing direction.
- Cabinet/Drawer/Refrigerator: opening/front direction.
- Door: direction the door opens into the room interior. (If unclear, face the larger adjacent space.)

### Length/Width assignment rule (prevents size/rotation bugs)
For each object:
1) First decide rotationZ (functional front).
2) Measure the object's WORLD footprint extents from the plan:
   - ΔX_world = size along X axis
   - ΔY_world = size along Y axis
3) Assign (Length, Width) CONSISTENTLY with rotationZ:
   - If rotationZ is 0 or 180:
       Length ≈ ΔX_world, Width ≈ ΔY_world
   - If rotationZ is 90 or 270:
       Length ≈ ΔY_world, Width ≈ ΔX_world

### Sanity checks (must do before finalizing)
- Every object center must lie inside the outer boundary.
- Objects must not overlap walls (keep a small margin from room boundaries).
- Relative ordering must match the image:
  If object A is clearly left of object B in the plan, then A_X < B_X (same for above/below).
- If any check fails, your origin or center-coordinate convention is wrong: redo measurement.

Your task (Step1):
1) Report overall floor plan size (use SCALE_* as exact if provided).
2) Identify all rooms. For each room, output a room polygon (vertices in CLOCKWISE order).
3) List ALL visible objects with:
   - center (X,Y), WORLD extents (ΔX_world, ΔY_world), size (Length x Width x Height), rotationZ.
4) Identify doors and windows with their wall-edge center coordinates.

Output format (structured bullet points):

## Overall
- Total size: [X]m x [Y]m
- Scale reference: (SCALE_* and grid if present)

## Rooms
- [room_id / name]: polygon vertices (clockwise)

## Objects
- [object_name] ([category]): center (X,Y), ΔX_world, ΔY_world, size (L x W x H), rotationZ

## Openings
- Door: center (X,Y), width, height, connects [Room A] <-> [Room B or outside]
- Window: center (X,Y), width, height, sill height

COORDINATE NORMALIZATION (CRITICAL):
- Output coordinates must be NON-NEGATIVE (X>=0, Y>=0).

### LAYOUT_HINTS (AUTHORITATIVE)
You will receive a key-value text block like:
OUTLINE=RECT
SCALE_WIDTH_M=...
SCALE_HEIGHT_M=...
ROOMS=...bedroom:1,...toilet:1,...
WINDOW_HEIGHT_M=...
WINDOW_SILL_M=...

Hard rules:
- area_size_X = SCALE_WIDTH_M and area_size_Y = SCALE_HEIGHT_M (exact).
- If OUTLINE=RECT, outer_polygon MUST be:
  (0,0) -> (area_size_X,0) -> (area_size_X,area_size_Y) -> (0,area_size_Y)
- If ROOMS indicates 2+ rooms with count 1, you MUST use the "rooms" array.
  You MUST NOT use the single-room fallback "room_polygon".
- Room polygons must NOT overlap. Adjacent rooms must share EXACT boundary coordinates.
  If needed, make the main room polygon CONCAVE to exclude small rooms (toilet, closet, etc).

### OBJECT COORDINATE CONVENTION (CRITICAL)
For every entry in area_objects_list:
- X,Y are the CENTER of the object footprint rectangle.
- NEVER use corner coordinates for X,Y.
- Length = local +X, Width = local +Y (functional front). Do NOT swap Length/Width after choosing rotationZ.

### Length/Width assignment rule (prevents size/rotation bugs)
If Step1 provides WORLD extents (ΔX_world, ΔY_world), use them:
- If rotationZ is 0 or 180:
    Length ≈ ΔX_world, Width ≈ ΔY_world
- If rotationZ is 90 or 270:
    Length ≈ ΔY_world, Width ≈ ΔX_world

### Coordinate fidelity (prevents drift)
- If Step1 numeric coordinates/sizes are provided, COPY them exactly into JSON.
  Do NOT re-estimate or re-scale from the image unless Step1 is missing.
- Use 0.01m precision.

### Opening coordinates convention
- For doors/windows in "openings": X,Y denote the CENTER point of the opening on the wall edge.
- Openings must lie exactly on a room boundary edge.

Placement rules:
1) Preserve the layout as drawn.
2) Always include a FLOOR object.
3) Do NOT output wall objects (walls come from room polygons).
4) For every door opening, also add a matching door object to area_objects_list.

RotationZ:
- 0: faces +Y, 90: faces +X, 180: faces -Y, 270: faces -X

Categories:
bed, table, desk, chair, sofa, wardrobe, drawer, shelf, cabinet,
toilet, sink, bathtub, shower, door, window, floor, appliance, equipment, other_furniture

search_prompt:
- Mostly English, generic description, no relative placement.

Remember: Output a single JSON object ONLY.

[SIZE_MODE OVERRIDE]
This override has highest priority over any previous size definition.
Use top-level `size_mode` = "local".
Length = object local +X (right), Width = object local +Y (forward / functional front), Height = local +Z.
rotationZ defines where object local +Y points in world (0:+Y, 90:+X, 180:-Y, 270:-X).
Do NOT swap Length/Width based on rotationZ.

## Overall
- Total size: **~8.5 m (X width) x ~11.5 m (Y depth)**
- Scale reference: **background grid/checker** and typical fixture sizes (bathtub ~1.6–1.7 m, interior doors ~0.75–0.9 m). The provided plan appears proportioned like a compact 2F/1F segment with LDK on left and circulation/service core on right.

1) tighter door swing directions per hinge side, and  
2) wall-by-wall segmentation (each wall as a line segment list) for cleaner procedural 3D wall generation.

[prompt1]
You are an interior layout analyst. Generate a detailed layout description for 3D scene generation.

Coordinate system (Z-Up, Isaac Sim):
- X: right (+X), left (-X)
- Y: forward/depth in the image (+Y toward top), backward (-Y toward bottom)
- Z: height (up)
- Origin (0, 0): bottom-left inner corner of the floor plan
- Units: meters

Your task:
1. Estimate the overall floor plan size (width X, depth Y) in meters.
2. Identify all rooms. For each room, estimate its bounding box and approximate polygon vertices.
3. List ALL visible objects with their estimated center coordinates (X, Y), size (Length x Width x Height), and orientation.
4. Identify doors and windows with their positions on walls.

## Rotation Definitions (CRITICAL)
Use the following rule to determine the rotation angle based on which way the object is "facing" (its functional front):
- 0°: faces +Y (toward top of image)
- 90°: faces +X (toward right of image)
- 180°: faces -Y (toward bottom of image)
- 270°: faces -X (toward left of image)

## Functional Front per Category:
- Chair/Sofa: The direction a seated person would face.
- Bed: From headboard toward the foot of the bed.
- TV/Monitor: The direction the screen is facing.
- Desk/Table: The side where a person would sit (if obvious), otherwise align with room walls.
- Refrigerator/Cabinet/Drawer: The direction it opens.
- Door: The direction the door opens into the room (interior).

## Output format - structured bullet points:

## Overall
- Total size: [X]m x [Y]m
- Scale reference: (describe any visible grid, scale bar, or reference object used)

## Rooms
For each room:
- [Room Name]: center (~X, ~Y), size ~[L]x[W]m, polygon vertices if non-rectangular

## Objects
For each visible object:
- [Object Name] ([category]): center (~X, ~Y), size ~[L]x[W]x[H]m, rotation [0/90/180/270]°, facing [direction/target, e.g., "facing TV" or "facing -Y"]

## Openings
- Door at (~X, ~Y): width ~[W]m, rotation [0/90/180/270]° (opens into room), connects [Room A] to [Room B]
- Window at (~X, ~Y): width ~[W]m, height ~[H]m, on [wall direction]

Be thorough but concise. This output will be used by Step 2 to generate precise JSON.

Placement rules:
1) The image is an XY top-down plan. Preserve the layout as drawn.
2) Right in the image is +X. Up in the image is +Y.
3) Use local size semantics: Length=local +X (right), Width=local +Y (forward/functional front), Height=local +Z (up).
   Do NOT swap Length/Width based on rotationZ.
4) Always include a FLOOR object in area_objects_list:
   - object_name: "floor", category: "floor"
   - X, Y: center of the overall plan
   - Length: area_size_X
   - Width: area_size_Y
   - Height: small thickness (e.g., 0.1)
   - rotationZ: 0
5) Do NOT output any "wall" objects. Walls are procedural from room polygons.
6) Doors/windows: include them in room openings when visible. Do NOT invent openings.
   For every door opening, also add a matching door object to area_objects_list.
   Use rotationZ to indicate the door opens into the room (interior).
7) Keep object placement faithful to the drawing. Do not move objects to fix collisions.
8) Room polygons must not overlap. Adjacent rooms should share the exact same boundary coordinates.
9) Openings must lie exactly on a room boundary edge (same X or same Y for axis-aligned walls).
   If a door is between two rooms, place it on the shared edge (can appear in both rooms or once).
10) If the building outline is not a rectangle, include "outer_polygon" with the true outline (concave allowed).
   Do NOT approximate the outer boundary as a rectangle.

Functional orientation (rotationZ):
- 0 degrees: faces +Y (image up)
- 90 degrees: faces +X (image right)
- 180 degrees: faces -Y (image down)
- 270 degrees: faces -X (image left)

Define functional front per category:
- Bed: direction a person faces from head to foot.
- Chair/Sofa: direction a seated person faces.
- TV/Display: direction the screen faces.
- Door: direction the door opens into the room (interior).
- Refrigerator/Drawer/Cabinet: direction the front opens.

Categories (use one of these unless absolutely necessary):
bed, table, desk, chair, sofa, wardrobe, drawer, shelf, cabinet, wheelchair,
toilet, sink, bathtub, shower, door, window, floor, appliance, equipment, other_furniture

search_prompt guidelines:
- Write mainly in English.
- Describe object type, usage context, and key attributes.
- Do NOT describe relative placement in this specific room.
